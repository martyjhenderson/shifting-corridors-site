# Shifting Corridors Lodge at Gamicon Bromine 2026

We're thrilled to announce that the Shifting Corridors Lodge will be hosting organized play at Gamicon Bromine, taking place March 6-8, 2026 in Coralville, Iowa!

## Event Highlights

This is going to be our biggest convention presence yet. We'll be running an impressive 19 tables of organized play throughout the weekend, featuring both Pathfinder Society and Starfinder Society games. Whether you're a seasoned adventurer or new to organized play, there will be something for everyone.

## Special Guest: Hilary Moon Murphy

We're honored to have special guest Hilary Moon Murphy joining us at the convention! Hilary is a talented author who has written scenarios for Paizo, and she'll be personally running three of her own scenarios during the event. This is a rare opportunity to experience her work firsthand with the author herself at the table.

## Both Systems Represented

Players will have the chance to dive into adventures across both game systems:
- **Pathfinder Society** - Fantasy adventures in the world of Golarion
- **Starfinder Society** - Science fiction exploration across the galaxy
