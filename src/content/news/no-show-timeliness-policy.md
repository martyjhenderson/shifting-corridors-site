# No Show and Timeliness Policy

We're implementing a new policy across all our gaming locations to ensure fair access to tables for all players.

## Policy Details

Effective immediately, Diversions, Tempest Games, and Geek City Games are implementing a timeliness policy for organized play sessions:

**If a player is more than 10 minutes late and there is a waitlist, their spot at the table will be given to the next person on the waitlist.**

## Why This Policy?

This policy helps ensure that:
- Players on waitlists have a fair opportunity to play
- Game Masters can start sessions on time
- All players who commit to attending are respectful of everyone's time

## What This Means for You

- **Arrive on time** - We recommend arriving 10-15 minutes early to get settled
- **Communicate** - If you're running late, contact the Game Master or venue as soon as possible
- **Sign up responsibly** - Only register for games you can commit to attending

## Questions?

If you have questions about this policy, please reach out to your Game Master or join us on Discord at [https://discord.gg/X6gmXYVDJA](https://discord.gg/X6gmXYVDJA) in the #iowa-corridor channel. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation in making our organized play sessions enjoyable for everyone.

Thank you for being part of our gaming community!
